    "text": "Activity: Using Rivanna\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal: Create your course directory structure on Rivanna.\n\n\n\nAfter reading the previous documents on Rivanna and Unix, try this activity to get acquainted with the Rivanna high-performance computing cluster at UVA.\nTo get started, go to OpenOnDemand Dashboard page and from the main menu select Clusters → Rivanna Shell Access.\nThis should open a terminal to what is called the “shell” of the operating system.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Rivanna shell\n\n\nRivanna uses Linux, a member of the Unix family of operating systems. Many cloud resources use Linux.\nUnderstanding how to do work from the command line on such systems is an essential skill of the data scientist.\nIf you have never used the command line, have no fear! Just enter the commands exactly as shown and ask questions in the Teams chat if you are stuck.\nNow, create a directory for your course and this course by entering the following commands:\ncd Documents \nmdkir MSDS \ncd MSDS \nmkdir DS5100 \ncd DS5100\nIf the Documents directory does not exist, create that first using the mkdir command.\n\ncd means “change directory,” and is a basic Unix command.\nmkdir means “make directory.” It’s also a basic Unix command.\n\nNote that you can use the tab key to complete path and command names as you type.\nYou don’t have to, but it would be a good idea to create subdirectories for any of your courses that use Rivanna.\nMore information about Unix shell commands can be found the document Unix Shell Commands.",

You can create this on both your computer and Rivanna, but for the assignment you need only create it on Rivanna.\n\n\nFork the course GitHub hosted repository (“repo”) to your GitHub account.\nGo to https://github.com/ontoligent/DS5100-activities in your web browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is the course activities repo — it will be used for activities and answer keys.\n\n\nClick on the Fork icon in the upper right and follow the prompts to finish the process.\nYou should end up at the web page of your newly forked repo.\nYou will now have a copy of the repo in your GitHub account.\nClone the forked repo for this course inside of your course directory on Rivanna.\nFind the green Code button and click on it.

We do it here to demonstrate the concept since it is so basic to working with GitHub in the real world.\nInstead of making pull requests, you will be using a separate repository for your work So, you will be working with two repositories going forard:\n\nThe Course Activities Repo, which is where you will find homework keys and exercises after the classes in which they are used. Update as necessary. We will also use this for some of the activities from the first modules.\nYour Assessments Repo, which is where you will put your finished work as assigned.\nThe Book Repo, which is where you will find the textbook for this course along with all of the notebooks in it.

We do it here to demonstrate the concept since it is so basic to working with GitHub in the real world.\nInstead of making pull requests, you will be using a separate repository for your work So, you will be working with two repositories going forard:\n\nThe Course Activities Repo, which is where you will find homework keys and exercises after the classes in which they are used. Update as necessary. We will also use this for some of the activities from the first modules.\nYour Assessments Repo, which is where you will put your finished work as assigned.\nThe Book Repo, which is where you will find the textbook for this course along with all of the notebooks in it. You may choose to clone or fork this, or you may download individual notebooks from the site as needed.",

As a reminder, the URL is https://rivanna-portal.hpc.virginia.edu/.\nFrom the Interactive Apps menu, select JupyterLab and fill out the form to initiate a new session. Your form should have the following values:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote that you may increase the number of hours, cores, and megabytes of RAM, but asking for too much will increase the time it takes to start your session. So select just the resources needed and enter our course allocation msds_ds5100 if this value is different than in the image above).\n\n\nOnce the session is ready, launch the notebook.\nOnce you are in the notebook, use file system tab on the left to get to the directory of your personal assessments repo. Remember, you created two repos for this class — one for course content from the instructor, and one for your own course work. Use the latter for this exercise.\nIn a code cell in the notebook, enter the code to print \"Hello, World!\", and run the cell.\nSave your notebook as hello-world.ipynb.",
